I was at a conference in Germany and started to feel very sick. I could barely move, but I had to take a plane to speak at another conference in Spain. In the middle of the flight, I called the flight attendant and said I needed help. <span class="highlight">The airplane landed, and I left there in an ambulance</span>.</p><p>I went to the hospital, took some blood tests, and started to feel better again. I thought it was just a food poisoning, and I was ready to leave that place. They got the results and <span class="highlight">took me straight to the emergency room.</span> I was having an episode of Pancreatitis.</p><p>Two days later, I was still at the hospital. My blood results were pretty bad, they didn&#x27;t allow me to leave, so I asked a co-worker to bring my laptop. At least with the internet, I could <a href="https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/390120821257039872">have a distraction</a>.</p><p>One day I left my room to get some water. <span class="highlight">When I got back, my computer was stolen</span>.</p><figure><a href="https://twitter.com/ipeychev/status/390138184329199617"><img src="/static/img/about.jpeg" alt="Me and my friend Iliyan Peychev"/></a><figcaption>Me and my friend Iliyan Peychev</figcaption></figure><p>I was completely devastated. That computer was the only way I could communicate with my family in Brazil. How could someone steal a person in a hospital bed? I couldn&#x27;t believe that whole situation.</p><p>The next day, my co-workers tried to cheer me up and <span class="highlight">brought a new laptop for me</span>. I had no backup to restore from, so I started to install everything back again. For every code editor, for every terminal app, I had to choose a different theme.</p><p>I always believed in the cost of context switching. I know how it feels when you&#x27;re <em>&quot;in the zone&quot;</em>, then suddenly, you get distracted and lose focus. It shouldn&#x27;t be that way, so <span class="highlight">I decided to create my own color scheme</span>, and my mission was to make it <span class="highlight">available everywhere</span>.</p><p><strong>October 27th, 2013</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme/commit/7e4d17ade6a54b7b7d8037a0d2160a293f17ef5c">My first commit</a> was the ZSH theme. Then I moved to iTerm, Terminal.app, Sublime Text, and Textmate. At the end of the first day, I already had 5 themes. I <a href="https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/395216794249486336">tweeted about it</a> and the community started to contribute.</p><p>Today Dracula is available everywhere and it&#x27;s one of the <span class="highlight">most popular themes ever created.</span></p><p>I stayed in that hospital bed for 3 weeks. I can&#x27;t even describe the feeling of being sick in a foreign country, alone and away from your family. Thanks Dracula, for distracting me when I needed the most.</p></main></div></div><p class="credits">Made with <span class="love">♥</span> by <a class="green" href="https://zenorocha.com" target="blank">Zeno Rocha</a><br/>under <a class="orange" href="http://zenorocha.mit-license.org/" target="blank">MIT license</a></p></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"dataManager":"[]","props":{"pageProps":{"query":{"title":"About Dracula","color":"cyan","icon":"dracula.svg","total":90}}},"page":"/about","query":{"title":"About Dracula","color":"cyan","icon":"dracula.svg","total":90},"buildId":"0JF06gcI77m-wGbOzWpeh","nextExport":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/runtime/polyfills-5fa5b8189f4681d353e9.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/about" src="/_next/static/0JF06gcI77m-wGbOzWpeh/pages/about.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/_app" src="/_next/static/0JF06gcI77m-wGbOzWpeh/pages/_app.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-08f7b238829422e3b9b2.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.b25037c73f7146623636.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-20cd029fb022ab21d015.js" async=""></script></html>
